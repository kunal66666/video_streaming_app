Exploring Microservices with Spring Boot 3: A Video Streaming App

In this project, we delve into the world of microservices using the cutting-edge Spring Boot 3 framework to build a real-world video streaming application. This project serves as a comprehensive guide to microservice development, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to create scalable, flexible, and maintainable applications.

Key Features and Objectives:
Foundations of Microservices

Using core principles of microservice architecture, including modular design, independent deployment, and scalability.
Service Registry

Implement a service registry (Eureka) to manage and discover services dynamically.
Configuration Server

Centralize and manage configurations for all microservices using Spring Cloud Config Server.
API Gateway

Set up an API Gateway for routing requests, load balancing, and enforcing security policies.
Distributed Tracing System

Use tools like Zipkin to trace and monitor interactions across microservices for debugging and performance optimization.
This project not only provides hands-on experience with essential microservice components but also prepares you to design and implement enterprise-grade applications efficiently.
